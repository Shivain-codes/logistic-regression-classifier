# Logistic Regression Binary Classifier

This project implements a **binary classification model using Logistic Regression**. The model is built with `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. It covers the full machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization — providing insights into threshold tuning and the sigmoid function.
